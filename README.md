##AutoLayoutCells

`AutoLayoutCells` makes working with custom table view cells easy. It has a powerful, well-designed feature set:

* Ready-to-use table view cells for the most common use cases
* Built-in support for dynamic font and responding to font change notifications
* Drop-in support for dynamic height cells (one-liner method calls to `ALCellFactory`)
* Convenience method to set all cell values from a dictionary (using predefined keys)
* Automatic image loading from a URL (built on `AFNetworking`)
